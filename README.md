# trny

A javascript package that extracts transactional info like account number, money spent, balance and type of transaction from a string

Demo [here](https://minimal-scouser.github.io/trny-demo)

Note: After developing this I was very excited and tested it on some bank alerts. The results were disappointing(I should have seen this coming). 

The parsing logic is weak. There are soooo many different formats of bank alerts out there. 

So if you want to improve this or doing something like this you may find the following steps useful

1. Collect as much varied data as you can.
2. Then work on parsing logic.

Data is king here. Without that your parser/engine will fail.

## Installation

```bash
npm install trny
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { getTransactionInfo } from "trny";

const message = "Your a/c XX0413 is debited on 15/12/2020 by INR 3,211.00 towards purchase. Avl Bal: INR 5,603.54.";

const info = getTransactionInfo(message);
 
/* 
info = {     
   account: {
    type: "account",
    no: "0413"
   },
   balance: 5603.54,
   money: 3211.00,
   typeOfTransaction: "debited"

*/
